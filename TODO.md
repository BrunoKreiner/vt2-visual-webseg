- Retrain websam with version 3 (@process-webis-webseg-20-websam-better)
- Highlight and Document the version improvements between process-webis-webseg-20 versions:
    Key Implementation Changes and Improvements
    - From Version 1 to Version 2:
        - Library Change: Switched from PIL's drawing functions to OpenCV's more efficient cv2.fillPoly
        - Memory Efficiency: Pre-allocated numpy array with correct dimensions instead of creating and converting PIL Image
        - Structural Change: Integrated into a class structure with better error handling
        - Type Specification: Added explicit dtype=np.uint8 for mask array
        - Naming Improvement: More descriptive function name (create_mask_from_polygons vs polygon_to_mask)
    - From Version 2 to Version 3:
        - Proper Multipolygon Handling: Correctly interprets the nested structure of multipolygons
        - Hole Recognition: Critical addition of hole handling logic (lines 141-144)
        - Semantic Clarity: Improved docstring ("with proper hole handling")
        - Structural Understanding: Recognizes that the first ring is the outer boundary and subsequent rings are holes
        - Nested Loop Structure: Changed to properly iterate through the multipolygon hierarchy
        - Version 3 correctly handles the GeoJSON-like structure of multipolygons where:
            - A multipolygon contains multiple polygons
            - Each polygon has one or more rings
            - The first ring defines the outer boundary
            - Subsequent rings define holes
- Validate manually the splits by split algorithm in @process-webis-webseg-20-websam-better-with-split
- Retrain websam with split (@process-webis-webseg-20-websam-better-with-split)
- How exactly do segmentation (websam) and object detection (yolo-ws) compare to each other with the b1-cubed metric? is this correctly implemented?
- Fully document and test BCubed F1 implementation
- Document inference time between yolo-ws and websam, memory and practical considerations
